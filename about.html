<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Dr Nilofer, founder of DOS Technologies and a healthcare AI product leader passionate about creating technology that truly serves people.
   My journey is rooted in hands on experience across clinical environments, insurance workflows, and product strategy, where I discovered my calling 
   to bridge healthcare and intelligent systems. I believe the future of care lies in thoughtful design, data driven insight, and human centered innovation.
   Every solution I build is guided by empathy for patients, respect for providers, and a commitment to delivering meaningful outcomes through scalable AI platforms.</p>

<p>Through DOS Technologies, I am building intelligent healthcare infrastructure that connects patients, providers, and payers into seamless digital experiences. 
  My work focuses on translating complex operational processes into elegant, automated systems that support care teams and enhance patient journeys. I bring together product leadership, 
  healthcare operations, and emerging technologies to create solutions that are practical, impactful, and built for real world adoption. My approach is deeply collaborative, driven by curiosity, 
  and inspired by the belief that technology should simplify lives while empowering those who deliver care.</p>

<p>At the heart of everything I do is a vision for a more connected, accessible, and patient centered healthcare ecosystem. 
  I am dedicated to expanding DOS Technologies beyond dental into broader medical domains, building interoperable AI platforms that support preventive care, 
  operational intelligence, and long term wellness. I am motivated by purpose, energized by innovation, and committed to creating technology with integrity, compassion, and measurable impact. 
  My goal is to help shape a healthcare future where intelligent systems work quietly in the background, allowing humans to focus on healing, connection, and growth.</p>
